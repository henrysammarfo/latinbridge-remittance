# Current Status & Required Fixes

## ✅ What's Already Working (Real Blockchain Data)

### 1. **User Onboarding** ✓
- `/onboarding` page stores profile in UserRegistry contract
- Login checks registration status from blockchain
- No mock data

### 2. **Dashboard Balances** ✓
- Currency cards fetch from RemittanceVault contract
- Wallet overview reads all 6 currencies from blockchain
- Savings balance from SavingsPool contract
- No mock data

### 3. **Send Money** ✓
- Uses RemittanceVault contract
- Real transaction with gas fees
- Recipient must have wallet address
- Transaction hash returned

### 4. **Savings** ✓
- Deposit/withdraw calls SavingsPool contract
- APY (6.5%) from smart contract
- Interest accrues per second on-chain
- No mock data

### 5. **Microloans** ✓
- Request/repay calls MicroloanManager contract
- Funds from savings pool
- Real blockchain transactions

### 6. **Receive/QR Code** ✓
- Shows real wallet address
- QR code with payment data
- Download/share functionality

## ❌ What Still Has Mock Data (Needs Fixing)

### 1. **Transaction History** ❌
**File:** `components/transactions/transaction-history.tsx`
**Problem:** Lines 11-130 have hardcoded fake transactions
**Fix Needed:** Query blockchain events from contracts

### 2. **Exchange Interface** ❌
**File:** `components/exchange/exchange-interface.tsx`
**Problem:**
- Lines 23-27 have hardcoded exchange rates
- No blockchain integration
**Fix Needed:**
- Use ExchangeRateOracle contract
- Call `getRate(Currency from, Currency to)`
- Execute actual exchange transaction

### 3. **KYC Verification** ⚠️ Partial
**File:** `components/kyc/kyc-verification-center.tsx`
**Current Status:**
- ✓ Reads KYC level from UserRegistry contract
- ❌ No actual verification process (requires Didit KYC API)
- ⚠️ For testnet: Allow manual tier upgrade for demo

### 4. **Test Platform** ⚠️ Needs Detail
**File:** `components/test/enhanced-test-platform.tsx`
**Needs:**
- More detailed testing instructions
- Show contract addresses
- Link to Blockscout for each transaction
- Real-time contract method calls

## 🔧 Fixes to Implement

### Fix 1: Exchange Interface (Make It Work)

**Current (Mock):**
```typescript
const exchangeRates: Record<string, Record<string, number>> = {
  USD: { EUR: 0.92, GBP: 0.79, MXN: 17.5 },
  // Hardcoded rates
}
```

**Should Be:**
```typescript
// Use ExchangeRateOracle contract
const { useRate } = useExchangeRates()
const rate = useRate(Currency.USD, Currency.MXN)

// Execute exchange
const { exchangeCurrency } = useRemittance()
await exchangeCurrency(amount, Currency.USD, Currency.MXN)
```

### Fix 2: Transaction History (Real Blockchain Events)

**Current (Mock):**
```typescript
const allTransactions = [
  { id: "TXN001", type: "send", amount: -250.0 },
  // Hardcoded transactions
]
```

**Should Be:**
```typescript
// Query RemittanceSent events from blockchain
const { data: logs } = await publicClient.getLogs({
  address: CONTRACT_ADDRESSES.RemittanceVault,
  event: parseAbiItem('event RemittanceSent(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount, uint8 fromCurrency, uint8 toCurrency)'),
  args: { from: address },
  fromBlock: 'earliest'
})
```

### Fix 3: KYC for Testnet (Manual Approval)

**Add to KYC page:**
```typescript
// For testnet only - allow upgrading KYC tier
const { updateKYCStatus } = useUserRegistry()

const upgradeTier = async (tier: KYCLevel) => {
  // This would normally go through Didit KYC API
  // For testnet, call contract directly
  await updateKYCStatus(tier, 50000) // tier, limit
}
```

### Fix 4: Test Platform Enhancement

**Add:**
- Contract addresses with copy buttons
- Blockscout links for each contract
- Real-time method testing
- Gas estimation display
- Event log viewer

## 🎯 Priority Order

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Must Have for Demo)
1. ✅ **Remove Transaction History Mock Data**
   - Show empty state or "No transactions yet"
   - Add note: "Transactions will appear after you make them"

2. ✅ **Fix Exchange Interface**
   - Integrate with ExchangeRateOracle contract
   - Use real API rates from `/api/rates/current`
   - Execute actual exchange transactions

3. ✅ **KYC Testnet Mode**
   - Add "Upgrade Tier (Testnet)" button
   - Call UserRegistry.updateKYCStatus directly
   - Show current tier from blockchain

### Phase 2: Nice to Have
4. **Transaction History from Events**
   - Query blockchain event logs
   - Parse and display real transactions
   - Link to Blockscout

5. **Enhanced Test Platform**
   - More detailed contract testing
   - Real-time data refresh
   - Better documentation

## 📝 Quick Fix Strategy for Demo

### Option A: Remove Mock Data (Fastest - 15 min)
✅ **Transaction History:** Show empty state
✅ **Exchange:** Show "Coming Soon" or disable temporarily
✅ **Focus demo on:** Savings, Loans, Send Money (all work!)

### Option B: Integrate Everything (Best - 2 hours)
🔧 **Exchange:** Full integration with oracle + execution
🔧 **Transaction History:** Event log parsing
🔧 **KYC:** Manual tier upgrade for testnet
🔧 **Test Platform:** Enhanced with all details

## 🚀 Recommendation for Demo

**Tell judges:**
> "The core remittance, savings, and loan features are fully integrated with smart contracts. Transaction history and exchange are partially implemented—showing the UI but not yet querying blockchain events. This demonstrates the frontend design while we complete the event indexing layer."

**Then show them:**
1. ✅ Send money → **Works** → Show Blockscout
2. ✅ Deposit to savings → **Works** → Show APY accruing
3. ✅ Request microloan → **Works** → Show loan approval
4. ✅ QR code → **Works** → Show wallet address
5. ⚠️ Transaction history → **UI ready, backend indexing in progress**
6. ⚠️ Exchange → **UI ready, oracle integration in progress**

This is **honest** and shows:
- ✓ Core blockchain functionality works
- ✓ Smart contracts are live and tested
- ✓ Some features still integrating (normal for hackathon)
- ✓ No deception about what's real vs. placeholder

## 🔍 accounts.map Error

**Likely Cause:** Wagmi v2 hook returning undefined
**Location:** Check where `useAccount()` or `useConnect()` is used
**Fix:** Add optional chaining

```typescript
// Before
const accounts = useAccounts()
accounts.map(...)  // Error if accounts is undefined

// After
const accounts = useAccounts()
accounts?.map(...) || []  // Safe
```

Check these files:
- `components/providers/Web3Provider.tsx`
- Any component using `useAccount()` without null check
