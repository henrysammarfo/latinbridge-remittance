# LatinBridge - Pitch Script
## LATIN HACK 2025 Submission

---

## 🎯 THE HOOK (0:00-0:15)
*Start with impact*

**"$165 billion.**

That's how much Latin American families send home every year in remittances.

But here's the problem: they're losing **$10 billion** to fees and delays.

**Traditional services charge 6-8% per transaction and take 2-3 days.**

We're solving this with LatinBridge."

---

## 💡 THE PROBLEM (0:15-0:45)

**"Let me paint you a picture:**

- Maria in the US sends $500 to her family in Mexico
- Western Union charges her $40 in fees (8%)
- Her family receives $460... three days later
- That $40 could feed her family for a week

**This isn't just inefficient—it's exploitative.**

50 million migrants face this every time they send money home.

**And it gets worse:**
- Hidden exchange rate markups
- Cash pickup requirements in unsafe areas  
- No financial services—just money transfer
- No way to build credit or savings

**The current system wasn't built for them. So we built one that is."**
