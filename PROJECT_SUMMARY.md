#### API Routes (Implemented)
- `POST /api/auth/connect` - Initialize wallet connection
- `POST /api/auth/verify` - Verify signature & get JWT
- `GET /api/rates/current` - Get live exchange rates

#### Blockchain Utilities
- ethers.js v6 integration
- Contract instance factories
- Provider and signer management
- Currency enum mappings
- Unit parsing/formatting helpers

### ✅ Configuration & Setup

#### Network Configuration
- **Network**: Polkadot Paseo Asset Hub Testnet
- **Chain ID**: 420420422
- **RPC URL**: https://testnet-passet-hub-eth-rpc.polkadot.io
- **Block Explorer**: https://blockscout-passet-hub.parity-testnet.parity.io

#### Hardhat Configuration
- Solidity 0.8.28 compiler
- Optimizer enabled (200 runs)
- Deployment scripts ready
- Network configuration for passetHub

## Next Steps - What YOU Need to Do

### 1. Fund Your Wallet ⚠️ REQUIRED
Your wallet needs PAS tokens for deployment gas fees:
- Visit: https://faucet.polkadot.io
- Select "Paseo Testnet"
- Enter your address: `0x...` (from private key in .env.local)
- Request tokens

### 2. Deploy Smart Contracts
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd c:\Users\RICHEY_SON\Desktop\latinbridge-remittance

# Compile (verify no errors)
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network passetHub
```

This will:
- Deploy all 6 contracts
- Configure contract interconnections
- Save addresses to `deployments/passetHub.json`
- Update `.env.local` with addresses

### 3. Verify Deployment
Check the block explorer links printed after deployment to verify contracts are live.

### 4. Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Test in another terminal
curl http://localhost:3000/api/rates/current
```

### 5. Connect Frontend
Your v0.app frontend can now connect to:
- API Base URL: `http://localhost:3000/api`
- Contract Addresses: Available in `deployments/passetHub.json` after deployment

## Important Notes

### ✅ What Works
- All contracts compile successfully
- No OpenZeppelin dependencies (under 100KB limit)
- Custom reentrancy guards implemented
- Exchange rate API supports ALL required currencies (including COP & GTQ)
- Wallet authentication fully functional
- Deployment scripts ready

### ⚠️ What's Pending (Lower Priority)
These can be added after initial deployment:
- Additional API routes (remittance history, savings, loans)
- Stripe payment implementation (fiat on-ramp)
- Unit tests for contracts
- More KYC API endpoints

### 🔐 Security Features
- Custom reentrancy protection on all state-changing functions
- KYC-based transaction limits
- Rate staleness protection
- Blacklist functionality
- Emergency pause capabilities
- Wallet-based authentication (no password storage)

### 📝 Git Configuration
- Branch: `backend-implementation` ✅ PUSHED
- Author configured as "Developer <dev@latinbridge.local>"
- Professional commit message without emojis
- Repository rules respected (no direct push to main)

## API Keys You Have

✅ All configured in `.env.local`:
- Polkadot Paseo RPC URL
- Private Key for deployment
- Didit KYC API credentials
- Stripe test keys
- ExchangeRate-API (free, no key needed)

## No Additional APIs Needed
