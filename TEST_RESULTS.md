## Issues Found & Fixes Needed

### Issue 1: Missing Faucet Instructions
**Severity:** Low
**Impact:** Users need PAS tokens to test
**Fix:** Add faucet link to dashboard/test page
**Faucet URL:** https://faucet.polkadot.io

### Issue 2: Payment Networks UI Not Complete
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** PIX/SPEI linking not available in UI
**Fix:** Build forms to call `linkPIXAccount()` etc.

### Issue 3: Mock Data Still Present
**Severity:** High
**Impact:** Some components show mock percentages/trends
**Location:**
- `/components/rates/exchange-rates.tsx:78` - `Math.random()` for change %
- `/components/rates/exchange-rates.tsx:79` - Random trend direction

**Fix Required:** Remove mock data and calculate real trends from historical rates
